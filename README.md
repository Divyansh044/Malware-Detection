# Malware Detection Project

This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on malware detection. We aim to build a robust and accurate malware detection system using machine learning techniques. Below is an overview of the project's main components and steps:

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: We have used the 'dataset_malwares.csv' dataset from KAGGLE for training and evaluation. This dataset contains various features related to malware samples, including whether they are malicious or benign.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We performed essential data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, resolving class imbalance, and addressing multicollinearity.

- **Oversampling**: To deal with class imbalance, we applied the SMOTETomek oversampling technique to create a balanced dataset for training.

- **Feature Scaling**: We standardized our dataset using Standard Scaling to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: After scaling, we applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving most of the information.

- **Model Training**: We trained machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, on the processed and scaled dataset.

- **Model Evaluation**: We evaluated our models using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and the F1 score.

- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: We also plotted the ROC curve and calculated the AUC-ROC score to assess model performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn).
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Model Performance

Our trained models achieved a certain level of accuracy in detecting malware samples. It's important to note that the performance of such models can vary depending on the dataset and the specific characteristics of the malware being analyzed.

## Future Work

We acknowledge that malware detection is an ongoing challenge due to the evolving nature of malicious software. In future iterations of this project, we plan to explore more advanced machine learning techniques, leverage larger and more diverse datasets, and incorporate real-time threat intelligence to enhance detection capabilities.
